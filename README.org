* Summary
In this repo are my solutions to [[https://adventofcode.com/][Advent of Code]] problems by year and
language.

* Running
Unless otherwise stated in more specific readme files run each solution for a
day by calling it on the command line with the input file as an argument.  For
example from the root of this repo:
#+begin_example
cd 2024/scheme/1/
./part-1 input
#+end_example

I've not added my input files to this repo, so if you want to run this for
yourself you'll have to make your own input files or grab your own from Advent
of Code.
